<h4>catching up. . .</h4>
<p>

When we last saw DeepTest, it was stepping intrepidly out into the world to parallelize your
tests.  Just a young buck but raring and ready to go.  A lot has
happened since then, and DeepTest has made it to its teen years (in the
world of software that means version 1.2 of course).
</p>

<p>
DeepTest now supports
parallelizing RSpec examples in addition to Test::Unit based tests.  RSpec
support was like DeepTest's first dance -- it takes a while to screw up the
courage to ask her out on the floor, but it gets easier with each dance. And so DeepTest has become quite the socialite. Making its full-blown debut into adolescence, DeepTest now happily distributes
tests remotely, simultaneously do-si-do-ing with any number of machines.
</p>

<h4>no more tripping over your own shoelaces</h4>
<p>

It used to be that DeepTest was young and clumsy when dealing with your
database.  Using a single database caused occasional deadlocks when multiple
tests collided on the same table.  DeepTest has grown up and learned
some database diplomacy.  If you tell it to, DeepTest will setup a separate
database for each worker, thus avoiding deadlocks.  If you're using Mysql
and ActiveRecord with a fairly vanilla setup, all you need is this in your
Rakefile:
</p>
<pre>
DeepTest::TestTask.new "task_name" do |t|
 ...
 t.worker_listener = "DeepTest::Database::MysqlSetupListener"
end
</pre>
<p>
 The MysqlSetupListener will dump the schema from your test database,
 create a new database for each worker, load the dumped schema, and then
 connect the workers to one of the databases.  And separate databases means
 no more deadlocks.
</p>
<p>
 If you're not using Mysql, DeepTest does not currently have out-of-the-box
 support for your database.  <tt>DeepTest::Database::SetupListener</tt> is
 available to help you, but you'll have to dig down and implement the details
 of creating and dropping databases and dumping and loading schemas.
</p>
<p>
If you do decide to help DeepTest grow by trying out other databases flavors, please
 consider contributing the code so others can benefit from your
 labor.
</p>

<h4>first dance with RSpec</h4>
<p>
Dancing with your RSpec examples is just as easy for DeepTest as playing
with your Test::Unit tests.  If you haven't done it yet, install the gem.
</p>
<p><tt>gem install deep_test</tt></p>

<p>Then put something like this is your Rakefile:</p>
<pre>
 require "rubygems"
 require "deep_test/rake_tasks"

 # sample SpecTask using DeepTest
 Spec::Rake::SpecTask.new(:deep_spec) do |t|
   t.spec_files = FileList['spec/**/*_spec.rb']
   t.deep_test :number_of_workers =&gt; 2   # optional, defaults to 2
 end
</pre>

<h4>get an entourage to do the work for you</h4>
<p>

The most exciting addition for DeepTest is the ability to distribute your tests
across multiple machines.  Instead of sitting there all by its lonesome on your
poor little developer machine, DeepTest can now command an army of machines to
do its bidding and run your tests even faster.  To get started you'll need 2
or more machines that will run tests (call them deeptest1 and deeptest2), and
your developer machine that has a project already using DeepTest to run
functional tests locally.  Both the deeptest machines will need to be able to
access the developer machine over password-less ssh. All machines involved need
to have rsync installed.  On deeptest1 and deeptest2, install the gem.  Then
start a test server on each one.

</p>
<p>
<tt>gem install deep_test</tt>
</p>
<p>
<tt>deep_test test_server</tt>
</p>
<p>
 For this example configuration, let's use deeptest1 as the master server that keeps track of the rest
 of the test servers.  On deeptest1, start a master server process.
</p>
<pre>
deep_test master_test_server \
           druby://deeptest1:4022/ \
           druby://deeptest2:4022/
</pre>
<p>
 (the line continuations are just to look nice, you can put it all on one line)
</p>
<p>
 Now change the test task in your rakefile to specify the distributed options for deeptest.
</p>
<pre>
DeepTest::TestTask.new "task_name" do |t|
 t.pattern = "test/**/*_test.rb"
 t.number_of_workers = 2
 t.distributed_server = "druby://deeptest1:4021"

 # If you don't have a database you can leave this line out.
 # If you have a non-Mysql database, please see the documentation
 #   at rubyforge.
 t.worker_listener = "DeepTest::Database::MysqlSetupListener"

 t.sync_options = {
   # assumes Rakefile is in the root of your project
   :source =&gt; File.expand_path(File.dirname(__FILE__)),

   # username on local machine that is accessible by deeptest1 and 2
   :username =&gt; "developer"
 }
end
</pre>
<h4>the big payoff</h4>
<p>
DeepTest was conceived because our functional tests hurt, and hurt bad.  We
originally reported that we felt pain over the 2 minute mark.  Local
parallelization solved the problem for us temporarily, but we kept adding
functional tests.  Eventually it reached the point were functional tests took 6
1/2 minutes to run <b>using DeepTest</b>.  It was time for a change.  By
distributing the tests to 3 machines, we brought our functional test run down
to 2 minutes again.  While we'll obviously keep growing, the higher
parallelization slows the growth.  But even better, we can
keep adding more machines to run test suites to scale the problem indefinitely.
</p>
<p>
Now if only DeepTest would get a job and move out!
